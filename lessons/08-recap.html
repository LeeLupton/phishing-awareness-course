                <li>
                    <strong>Lesson 1:</strong> Phishing emails are designed to trick you into revealing sensitive information or installing malware. Always verify the sender.

                <li>
                    <strong>Lesson 2:</strong> Check email addresses carefully for misspellings, extra characters, or unfamiliar domains.

                <li>
                    <strong>Lesson 3:</strong> Inspect links before clicking. Hover over them to check their destination or use link-scanning tools.

                <li>
                    <strong>Lesson 4:</strong> Be cautious with attachments, especially unexpected ones. Avoid opening .exe, .zip, or macro-enabled files (.docm, .xlsm).

                <li>
                    <strong>Lesson 5:</strong> Recognize emotional triggers like urgency, fear, or greed that phishing emails exploit.

                <li>

            <h2>Final tips for staying safe</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Stay skeptical:</strong> Treat any unexpected email with caution, especially if it asks for sensitive information or urges immediate action.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Keep software updated:</strong> Ensure your email client, browser, and antivirus software are up to date to reduce vulnerability to attacks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Double-check URLs:</strong> Manually type known URLs into your browser instead of clicking links in emails.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Enable two-factor authentication:</strong> Protect your accounts by requiring a second form of verification during login.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Educate others:</strong> Share what youâ€™ve learned with colleagues, friends, and family to help them avoid phishing attacks.
                </li>
