            <h2>Why do phishing emails use emotional triggers?</h2>
            <p>
                Phishing emails often rely on emotional manipulation to create urgency or fear. 
                Attackers aim to make recipients act impulsively by bypassing logical thinking. 
                Recognizing these triggers can help you identify and avoid phishing attempts.
