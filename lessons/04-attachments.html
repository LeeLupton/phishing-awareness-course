            <h2>Why are attachments risky?</h2>
            <p>
                Email attachments can contain malicious software or scripts designed to compromise your system. 
                Cybercriminals use attachments to deliver malware such as ransomware, spyware, or trojans, 
                putting both personal and organizational data at risk.

            <h2>Common types of malicious attachments</h2>
            <p>
                Not all file types are dangerous, but some can be risky depending on their content. Here are examples of file types 
                commonly exploited in phishing attacks:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>.exe:</strong> Executable files that can install malicious software on your computer. 
                    These should never be opened unless you are certain of their source.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>.zip/.rar:</strong> Compressed files that may contain multiple malicious files. Always scan these with antivirus software before extracting.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>.docm/.xlsm:</strong> Macro-enabled Word or Excel files that can execute malicious scripts. 
                    Regular <strong>.docx</strong> and <strong>.xlsx</strong> files are typically safe but should still be verified if unexpected.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>.pdf:</strong> While most PDFs are safe, some may exploit vulnerabilities in outdated PDF readers or include links to malicious websites.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Red flags in attachments</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Unexpected or unsolicited attachments:</strong> Emails from unknown senders with attachments should always be treated as suspicious.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Generic filenames:</strong> Files named <strong>"invoice.pdf"</strong> or <strong>"document.zip"</strong> could be bait.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Urgent tone:</strong> Phrases like "Please download and open immediately" are often designed to pressure you into acting without thinking.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Large file size:</strong> Large attachments from unknown sources could be disguised malware.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>How to handle suspicious attachments</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Do not open the attachment unless you are certain of its legitimacy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Verify the sender's identity by contacting them directly using a known email or phone number.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use antivirus software to scan the attachment before opening it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Report the email to your IT team or email provider for further analysis.
                </li>
            </ol>
