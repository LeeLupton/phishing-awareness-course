            <h2>What is a phishing email?</h2>
            <p>
                A <strong>phishing email</strong> is a deceptive email that attempts to trick the recipient into sharing sensitive information 
                (e.g., passwords, bank account details) or performing an action that benefits the attacker, like clicking a malicious link.
            </p>
            <p>
                These emails often appear to be from legitimate organizations, such as banks, service providers, or even trusted coworkers, 
                but their goal is to exploit your trust and steal your information.

            <h2>What could someone possibly gain from a successful phishing attempt?</h2>
            <p>
                A successful phishing attempt can provide the attacker with:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Access to your sensitive accounts, such as email or bank accounts.</li>
                <li>Personal or financial information to commit identity theft.</li>
                <li>Login credentials to breach company systems.</li>
                <li>Access to customer information or trade secrets, which can be sold or exploited.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What is the worst that can happen from clicking a random link?</h2>
            <p>
                Clicking a malicious link in a phishing email can result in:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Malware Installation:</strong> The link may download and install harmful software on your device, 
                    such as ransomware, spyware, or keyloggers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Credential Theft:</strong> The link could lead to a fake login page, where entering your credentials 
                    hands them directly to the attacker.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>System Breach:</strong> If connected to a company network, clicking the link could provide attackers 
                    with a foothold to compromise the entire system.
                </li>

            <h2>Why would someone target a small real estate firm?</h2>
            <p>
                Small businesses like real estate firms are often targeted because:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Perceived Lack of Security:</strong> Attackers assume smaller firms donâ€™t have advanced security systems 
                    or dedicated IT teams.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Valuable Data:</strong> Real estate firms handle sensitive information, including financial documents, 
                    client details, and transaction records.
                </li>
                <strong>Access to Larger Networks:</strong> Compromising a small firm can serve as an entry point to larger 
                    networks or partnerships.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Lower Detection Risk:</strong> Smaller firms may take longer to detect a breach or phishing attempt, 
                    allowing attackers to operate unnoticed.
                </li>
            </ul>
