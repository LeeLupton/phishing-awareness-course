            <h2>Why is it important to report suspicious emails?</h2>
            <p>
                Reporting phishing emails helps protect your organization and others from cyberattacks. When you report 
                a suspicious email, your IT team or email provider can block the sender, investigate the threat, and 
                prevent further attacks.
