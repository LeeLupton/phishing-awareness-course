            <h2>Why should you check email addresses?</h2>
            <p>
                Cybercriminals often disguise their phishing emails to look like legitimate communication.
                Checking the sender's email address is one of the simplest ways to detect potential phishing attempts.
                A carefully crafted email might look authentic at first glance but could reveal its true nature upon closer inspection.

            <h2>Common red flags in email addresses</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Misspelled domains:</strong> Attackers may use addresses like <strong>support@rnicrosoft.com</strong> 
                    instead of <strong>support@microsoft.com</strong> (notice the "rn" instead of "m").
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Extra characters:</strong> A legitimate address like <strong>info@paypal.com</strong> might be spoofed as 
                    <strong>info@paypal-support.com</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Generic senders:</strong> Be cautious of addresses like <strong>noreply@secure.com</strong>, which lack context 
                    about the organization they represent.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Unfamiliar domains:</strong> A bank email from <strong>support@bankofamerica-customerservice.com</strong> 
                    should be treated as suspicious.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How to view the full email address</h2>
            <p>
                Many email clients hide the sender's full email address by default, showing only the display name 
                (e.g., "Amazon Customer Service"). Here's how you can reveal the full address:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Gmail:</strong> Click on the sender's name in the email header to expand the full email address.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Outlook:</strong> Hover over or click on the sender's name to see the email address.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Apple Mail:</strong> Click the dropdown arrow next to the sender's name to reveal the full address.
                </li>
            </ul>
